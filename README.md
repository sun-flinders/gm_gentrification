### Greater Manchester Gentrification Index

### Authors: Sophie Flinders & Adam Almeida

### Description: 
This project is a quantitative analysis of gentrification in the Greater Manchester area between 2013 and 2023.  
The Gentrification Index uses five measures: 
 - Change in BAME residents between 2013 and 2022
 - Change in median house price between 2013 and 2023
 - Change in annual income between 2012 and 2020
 - Population churn: how many people have left the LSOA between 2013 and 2023
 - Residential mobility and deprivation: where movers out of an area have moved to more or less deprived LSOAs
